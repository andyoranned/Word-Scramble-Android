# Word-Scramble-Android-App
Christmas themed word scramble game for Android Mobiles. 

# What?
This was both a first and final project. By that I mean, it was my first Android application--ever--and it was also my final project for my COSC-1437 Programming Fundamentals II class. I built it in 2021 with only 8 months of programming experience under my belt. Looking back at the code, I made some "interesting" choices. 

# License & Reuse
If you have a similar project or need and idea for a good beginner project for Android, feel free to use this code as a jumping off point. In fact, use it for whatever you like. If you can monetize it, go for it! Or if you just need something to blow your nose one, I would imagine that it's well suited for that too. I will not hold you back.
